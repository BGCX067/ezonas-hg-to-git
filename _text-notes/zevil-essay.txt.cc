I wanted to make a game, because I played so much the best legendary games there was out there, after all these hours spent, I ended up feeling frustrated, not because of the game's quality, but because I played too much.

Having played too much I knew those games by heart. Metal Gear Solid, Warcraft 3, Counter Strike, Quake 3, Resident Evil, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Gran Turismo, and so on.
I was neither a PC or console oriented gamer, games were the ultimate experience for me, and I wanted to enjoy myself the most I can.

So after all those hours spent, knowing the game, I spent time deciphering the mechanics of the gameplay, what was the advantages of the design decisions, what was enjoyable and what was not.

3D brought a lot of new experiences, and at the beginning, 3D was hard. Resources were scarce, it was hard to make a nice looking 3D level, and it was hard to make 3D games that would be decent looking enough to compete with other games.
Making a game that combines beautiful graphics and good gameplay was a hard task, in the 90s the video game market was growing, but still not big enough, so the gems you could play for tens of hours without feeling bored were rare, and not being a rich teen, I made sure to read magazines to make my purchase as profitable as I could. It could be perceived as being nerdy, but and I wanted to make sure to enjoy myself without ruining myself, since I did not get out much (did I said I was not a nerd ? whatever).

Not being allowed to afford other games, I wanted the best ones to be better than they already were, why ? Because playing a good game even for 50 hours, at some point, it gets repetitive.

So what did I do ?

While some afforded a computer to learn programming, I continued to play my games and to fantasize about what I could improve in games.
