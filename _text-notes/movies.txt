I get the "OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT MOVIE" so often now that I've started a list of must-see movies that I need to watch! My friend and I threw this together on the way to class, so it's by no means comprehensive.
The bf is a cinephile and I have disgraced him. Help me restore my honor, reddit! What's your favorite movie? What do I need to see?
