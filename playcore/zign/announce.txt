Hello, my name is Jonas aka jokoon, I'm currently in game programming school, and I've started my personnal project.

I have several things to say about it. Here are the most important ones:

* It's very personnal: I've wanted to make a game since the age of 12 

* It's a long term project, because I want to implement several things, which I can put in a priority list, but for me it will take 2 to 5 versions of the game to be "finished".

* I want it to be a low-spec game, and I'm not concerned by the art quality.

Here are more detailed goals for the game:

Gameplay axed on competitive multiplayer.
I don't want to implement multiplayer right off, because that's one of the most sophisticated implementation. Even though, I'm designing the gameplay so that the game feel nervous.

Designed to be deeply modded.
	I want this game to be very modifiable. What I mean by "very" is that it will be focused on gameplay modification rather than content modification. For this, some parts will be kept open, and some won't.
