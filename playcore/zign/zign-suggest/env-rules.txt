missile launcher : engage missile, pilot with direction (not half-life like laser system, rather some "wii" thing), bouncing rocket (push to hold bounce mode, release ro deactivate, repush to explode)


CS

/me dreams :
- Pistols precision fixed since 1.5 : removed
- Snipe delay : removed
- Shield : removed
- increased move speed
- only 2 types of damage zone : first is head and lungs, ratio is 2; second is the rest of the body and ratio is 1
- ability to knock down other players, for example with a 5s delay, pursue that idea :)
- add some kind of CQCô combat principe : disarm enemies and throw his weapon 5m away, threat enemy, force enemy to stand on the ground, 2s delay to get up
- limited ammos for AWP : only 5 ammos in a clip, total of 2 or 3 clips maximum
- HUD : visual display of left bullets in clip (like : [UUUU        ]), static crosshair, ("lean player", the little arrow on team mates, like q3 team games)
- grouped buying of equipment, allow players to throw a gravel or some illusion object to divert enemy's listening

AND A LOT MORE
