Humans have more than five senses. Although definitions vary, the actual number ranges from 9 to more than 20. In addition to sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, which were the senses identified by Aristotle, humans can sense

balance and acceleration (equilibrioception),
pain (nociception),
body position (proprioception or kinesthetic sense), and
temperature change (thermoception).

[102] Other senses sometimes identified are the sense of

time,
itching,
pressure,
hunger,
thirst,
need to urinate, and
need to defecate.[103]
