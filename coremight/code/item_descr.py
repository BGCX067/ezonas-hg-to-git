# Some lists

########################### close combat weapon ###########################
blade =
"plasma 1 feet long. remembers me some funny movies about wars and stars. Was a funny movie though. the main character looks gay"

kitchen =
"I'm... dexter. More seriously, this is ideal if somebody tries to fuck with my mind again."

ripclaw =
"steel classic blade. a blade I can punch with to be somewhat more... unkind"


########################### aim guns ###########################
klobr =
"some standard semi automatic gun can use high velocity munitions"

lark =
"Quite a special and hitek pistol. It looks like the big israelian pistol, except is much thinner and much lighter; even the trigger looks electronic"

mp49r =
"modern gun, standard in the military and quite powerful"

k97 =
"heavy bullet weapons, very deadly and noisy, but ultimately effective for emergency situations"

fl71 =
"nextgen multi purpose weapons handles:"

psg9 =
"quite useful in a large area or if I'm hidden, or proned"

enrjgun =
"stupid experimentation from some mechanic engineer. from what I guess, he died while crafting this piece of weapon. this lab was painted in blood. Apparently it is some kind of polyvalent weapon that can use a big source of energy and deliver its firepower in different wayI saw this at work, it either is a magnetic rail, a magnetic cone wave pulsar and a tesla shock ray"

flakspr =
"seriously, I know the shotgun, but this thing is too much.This fires burning, electric charged, acid plumber pellets. apparently when I switch mode, it also fires without bursting the pellet, and just send the ammo which bursts when hitting. No seriously, the guy who designed this HAS to have problem with, I don't know, god or even himself. Why so evil ? One thing is sure, it will serve on this cell things and... well I'll hope I won't have to meet any other zombie..."

ezgun =
"electric gun: send a very few photons, shocks the enemy without killing it. silent (5m) Very useful when you have to kidnap somebody or, let's say, make him stfu for 1min"

#fpgun =
#"a quite heavy gun that creates a cone-like magnetic force field, that repulse every metal, or other matter, depending on the power. In particul mode, make a mini nuclear explosion"

snaket =
"A very smally pistol with a silencer on it: it's hard to say this makes noice, but its ammo are quite vicous: it can either be piercing shrapnel or poison syringe. Ideal for quick assassinate missions, but very little ammo per clip, is seems to have some sophisticated system to crack the bullet at the moment if fires"

########################### AMMOS ###########################
stdb =
"classic bullets, not deadly if I aim right."

hvel =
"semtex charged, this pierce almost anything. much more recoil though"

srg =
"1min of stfu. rare piece of ammo, very tiny, and painless."

combcap =
"some strange kind of heavy battery"

flak =
"what is that ?"

fl =
"Some gelified mini balls bullets. Funny to shoot at girl's ass, without leaving any mark."

stackcap =
"some other odd batery... there is some fluid inside... it says 'DO NOT EVER PIERCE' I'm tempted to try."

########################### tools ###########################

pen =
"this pen has three ink, one normal, one that fades out, and one that reveals for a short period of time. much useful for my sister, but I can communicate with this..."

zpda =
"this tool spy on radio com, connects to internet, can be used as a phone, and even with a peer chat system."

lighter =
"this electronic lighter also has a mini tazer in it, to burn electronic system."

gogle =
"// that scope comes with a gyroscope, so that it doesn't shakes at all. quite useful... when I'll be out of there..."
########################### item ###########################
serum =
"a little sleep with some mix that removes memory, unlike the srg amo"
pill =
"A neuro booster. my brains feels like on fire every thing is fast and slow at the same time. I don't feel any addiction, just 'like' anti depressant"

ezy = "I don't know how this works, but i not only can see in the dark with it, but I can also see sound from a very large range of frequency, optic irregularities, and gaz for gaz I really don't know how its done, but I can trace a guy from a very long distance with that even with a lot of wind"


########################### kits ###########################
breath =
"some technology inspired from fishes. will tell my girl friend I have one and get another one, we'll go naughty in the swimming pool! :)"

lightbender =
"At least, an invention that has a real utility: I'm not completely invisible, but enough so that nobody spots me from long distances. this seems to use a lot of battery, and it can't stay one for more than 1 minute per battery."

spyborg =
"invis fly-sized cyborg: can listen and watch upto a 10m radius. very low speed. on the remote, there is a autodestruct button. spyborgs can fly if I launch them or if it jump"


########################### bomb ###########################

rocket =
"Quite fun to use I just launch it, and the props fires"

missl =
"This is quite magic: I just have to lock something, and this run and explodes to its target: it evens find its way all alone !"

fire_gr =
"napalm like. 'thermite' is written in red. Useful if the temperature goes down or to cook some fish."

mqrk_gr =
"I guess the designer of this 'thing' didn't even care about explaining what this does. apparently it creates some expulsing magnetic force field, which pushes everything around to at least 5m. Not very smart to use, but anyway, can be efficient..."

smtex_gr =
"Ideal to blow zombies. reminds of some... Save the Ryan scene. No, seriously, this is deadly, and no fun to use"

########################### tactics ###########################

tron_gr =
"jam radar, electronic system and spyborgs."

light_gr =
"blackens screen for 3s, reveals invis in a 25m radius. Seems to create some sort of matter-safe blackhole after it explodes if I close my eyes."

wave_gr =
"I hate this one: this creates a very noisy wave that brokes all structures around. sometimes it even crack plexiglas and some heavy metals. ideal to break those nasty armored doors"

wind_gr =
"as if puppy poopy lets go a big fart. played team fortress, called it conc grenade"
