RADAR
either cam OR radar
if both, radar is little

radar will be updated maximum 10 time per frame, to save gpu cycles
basic radar will be updated 3 times per frame, so ultimately, once in 20 frames
I won't display fov like in mgs.
Only a one third of a circle's arc, either a T, both of the non symetric segment representing the eyes: the T will have green, blue, yellow and red color to
signals sense and concentration indicators:

green:
normal and peaceful
totally unaware of your presence

blue:
idling, but aware of either your presence, or 'alert' of some...
"disturbance in the force" iyswwim: this the "fear effect" telling
the IA is not feeling sure about the situation

yellow:
you are spotted. Besides the approximative look, the character will also
remember you for 1, 3 to 5 min depeding on its senses and concentration

red:
this is the maximum state: not only are you spotted, but the character look at you and observes you. It is not that you look strange, she/he fells in love or think about you naked or else, but the IA will remember you if another IA comes talking with him for suspicious activity, and this, until the IA is killed or bribed.

Nafnaf
naf is a cat dressed for diversion and object recovery.
just show her a drawing of an object, and she'll try to recover it for you.
She is animaly smart enough to explore building, but in some special cases, you can show her a map.
if you just sent her to make a diversion, she can start to "take care" of a sentry or surveillance guard by attracting him or annoying him.
She can also kill dogs, except if she's alone against two other animals
beware of not losing her, anyway, you can find her if something happen even if she dies
