Hello :)

I'm a game programmer student in a private game programming school.

I have an open source/free project in mind, I started coding it something like 3 months ago, it's not just contest project or student project, I want to be able to program it as long as possible... and I need at least one very little level to start toying with.

I'm basically trying to make some sort of Counter-Strike clone, but of course I have tons of cheap ideas which takes time to implement.

I'd like to know if you guys have some level of some kind that would fit in the spirit of the game, preferably not hi poly (yes I know, sorry), and with textures not bigger than 512*512 or 256*256, something preferably free or giveaway...

I'm not asking for someone to do something, because my project is in early stages,
