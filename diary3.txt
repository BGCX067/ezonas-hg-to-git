Some talking with my internship tutor about programming practices and how I find OOP to be full of non-sense for the industrial world.

It seems I'm the guy in Good Will Hunting, with a bad ending: I am all alone, an outsider looking in, slowly learning, but still alone and not giving a shit.

It might take a lot of time for me to come out of this area, or I might even never come out.
