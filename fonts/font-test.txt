The word death comes from Old English; deað, which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic dauthaz (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Germanic stem dheu- meaning the 'Process, act. condition of dying'.
Dauthaz was reconstructed through the use of the daughter tongues of Proto-Germanic, such as doth from Old Saxon, dath from Old Frisian, dood from Dutch, tod from Old High German, dauði from Old Norse, död from Swedish, and dauþas from Gothic.[2]
