Greed and politics: what future do we have ?

I'm 25, still at school, and I'm horrified how our society is flawed by greed and corruption: I'm nearly turning anti social when I realize what is happening in the "core" of our society (investment and corporations), even as a young teenager I was very afraid of this world.

I don't want to bring the debate into conspiracies or politics, because this is an investigation subject and there are a lot of thing one can watch/read to build his/her own opinion, but I think we are at a turning point in our world, and there are things my opinion alone cannot conclude.

Recently I watched "Inside Job" (it won an oscar).

We can think of he future of the economy in two ways: a slow, nice and good improvement of the situation, or either bad consequences that will make things change (not an apocalypse, but a drastical change).

If it's good, well, things will just slowly get better. and I watched this movie for nothing.

If it's bad, what kind of changes can happen to fix things ? Will this economic crisis change the course of history, and if yes, what will it change ?
